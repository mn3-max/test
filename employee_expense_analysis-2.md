# Employee Expense Analysis - Indian Automotive Companies

## Maruti Suzuki India Limited

### Overview

Maruti Suzuki's employee expenses exhibit a consistent upward trajectory. For FY 2024-25, standalone employee benefit expenses amounted to approximately **₹6,137 crore**, representing an increase of around 12% year-on-year (YoY). For Q1 and Q2 of FY26, consolidated quarterly employee benefit expenses were approximately **₹2,048 crore** and **₹2,052 crore**, respectively, indicating a growth rate that surpasses the corresponding growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis.

### FY25 Annual Overview (Standalone Figures)

For the fiscal year 2024-25, Maruti Suzuki's standalone net revenue from operations was approximately **₹145,115 crore**, an increase of 7.5% from **₹134,938 crore** in FY24. Total expenses grew by 7.6%, rising from **₹127,747 crore** to approximately **₹137,467 crore**. Within this structure, employee benefit expenses increased from approximately **₹5,478 crore** in FY24 to **₹6,137 crore** in FY25, representing a robust 12% YoY growth, which outpaced revenue growth.

As a proportion of total expenses, employee costs increased marginally from approximately 4.3% in FY24 to about 4.5% in FY25. Similarly, as a percentage of total revenue, employee costs moved from approximately 3.8% to 3.9%, indicating a modest but discernible increase in the cost of human capital relative to the size of the business.

#### FY24-FY25 Comparative Metrics

| Metric | FY24 (Mar 24) (₹ crore) | FY25 (Mar 25) (₹ crore) | Comment |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Net Revenue from Operations | 134,937.8 | 145,115.2 | 7.5% YoY growth, driven by volumes and exports. |
| Total Revenue (incl. other income) | 144,787.4 | 156,650.5 | Approx. 8.2% YoY growth in total income. |
| **Employee Benefit Expenses** | **5,478.4** | **6,137.0** | **Approx. 12% YoY increase, exceeding revenue growth.** |
| Total Expenses | 127,747.0 | 137,467.3 | Approx. 7.6% YoY increase, broadly in line with revenue. |
| Profit Before Tax (PBT) | 17,040.4 | 19,183.2 | PBT up approx. 12.6% YoY. |
| Employee Cost as % of Total Expenses | ~4.3% | ~4.5% | Slightly higher employee share of the cost base. |
| Employee Cost as % of Total Revenue | ~3.8% | ~3.9% | People costs rising marginally faster than the top line. |

The annual figures confirm that absolute employee expenses are growing faster than both revenue and total expenses, consistent with factors such as wage inflation, headcount additions, and higher variable compensation due to strong performance. Despite this, employee costs remain a relatively small component of the overall cost structure (in the mid-single-digit range), which continues to be dominated by material costs and purchased vehicles.

### Q1 FY26 Employee Costs (Consolidated Figures)

For the first quarter of FY26 (quarter ended June 2025), consolidated revenue from operations was approximately **₹38,605 crore**, showing a YoY increase of around 7.6%. Over the same period, employee benefit expenses escalated from approximately **₹1,758 crore** in Q1 FY25 to about **₹2,048 crore** in Q1 FY26. This translates to a substantial YoY growth of approximately 16-17% in staff costs, significantly higher than the single-digit revenue growth.

Employee benefit expenses in Q1 FY26 were about **₹2,048 crore** out of total expenses of **₹35,585 crore**, representing approximately 5.7-5.8% of total expenses and about 5.3% of revenue for the quarter. This quarterly intensity of employee costs is higher than the FY25 annual average, reflecting the impact of both annual increments and ongoing capacity expansion efforts.

#### Q1 FY26 Comparative Metrics

| Metric | Q1 FY26 (₹ crore) | Q1 FY25 (YoY reference) (₹ crore) | Comment |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Revenue from Operations | 38,605 | ~35,870 (Implied) | Approx. 7.6% YoY revenue growth. |
| **Employee Benefit Expenses** | **2,048** | **1,758** | **Approx. 16.5% YoY increase in staff costs.** |
| Total Expenses | 35,585 | Noted as lower base in Q1 FY25 | Cost base growing broadly with scale. |
| Profit After Tax (PAT) (Consolidated) | 3,792 | 3,760 | Marginal YoY increase despite higher costs. |
| Employee Cost as % of Revenue | ~5.3% | ~4.9% (Approx) | Employee cost intensity is up on a YoY basis. |

The analysis shows that employee costs in this quarter grew more than twice as fast as revenue, indicating higher per-employee compensation and/or increased manpower deployment ahead of demand, even though overall profitability remained stable.

### Q2 FY26 Employee Costs (Consolidated Figures)

In Q2 FY26 (quarter ended September 2025), consolidated revenue from operations reached approximately **₹42,344 crore**, compared to **₹37,449 crore** in Q2 FY25, marking a robust 13% YoY growth. Consolidated employee benefit expenses in this quarter increased from approximately **₹1,680 crore** in Q2 FY25 to **₹2,052 crore** in Q2 FY26, a significant approximately 22% YoY increase in people costs.

Sequentially, however, employee benefit expenses remained almost flat (**₹2,048 crore** in Q1 FY26 vs. **₹2,052 crore** in Q2 FY26, a rise of only ~0.2%), despite revenue growing by approximately 9-10% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). This highlights the operational leverage gained on the human resources side. As a proportion of revenue and total expenses in Q2 FY26, employee costs were approximately **4.8%** of revenue (**₹2,052/₹42,344**) and about **5.3%** of total expenses (**₹2,052/₹39,018**).

#### Q2 FY26 Comparative Metrics

| Metric | Q2 FY26 (₹ crore) | Q1 FY26 (₹ crore) | Q2 FY25 (₹ crore) | Key Observations |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Revenue from Operations | 42,344 | 38,605 | 37,449 | Revenue up ~13% YoY and ~9.7% QoQ. |
| **Employee Benefit Expenses** | **2,052** | **2,048** | **1,680** | **~22% YoY increase; flat QoQ.** |
| Total Expenses | 39,018 | 35,585 | 33,879 | Cost base rising, but slower than revenue YoY. |
| Profit Before Tax (PBT) | 4,339 | 4,943 | 5,140 | PBT down QoQ and YoY despite higher revenue. |
| Profit After Tax (PAT) | 3,349 | 3,792 | 3,102 | PAT up YoY, down QoQ. |
| Employee Cost as % of Revenue | ~4.8% | ~5.3% | ~4.5% | Higher employee share vs. prior-year Q2. |
| Employee Cost as % of Total Expenses | ~5.3% | ~5.8% | ~5.0% | Trending up vs. the prior-year quarter. |

This quarter reinforces the pattern: staff costs grow markedly faster than revenue on a YoY basis, but are successfully controlled sequentially, implying tighter management of fresh hiring and pay-outs during Q2 despite higher volumes and revenue.

### Key Trends and Interpretation

1. **Strong FY25 Base with Rising People Intensity:** Over FY24-25, standalone employee benefit expenses grew at approximately 12%, compared to ~7.5-8% growth in revenue and total income. This marginally increased employee costs as a share of both total expenses and revenue, pointing to a combination of annual wage hikes, higher incentives in a record-profit year, and necessary manpower additions to support enhanced production and exports.

2. **Quarters Show Sharper YoY Escalation:** In Q1 and Q2 of FY26, consolidated employee expenses showed substantial YoY increases of ~16-17% and ~22%, respectively, against revenue growth of ~7.6% and ~13%. This indicates that the labour cost per unit of revenue is drifting upwards on a quarterly basis. The share of employee costs in total expenses during these quarters (approx. 5-6%) is notably higher than the FY25 standalone annual average (~4.5%), underscoring a step-up in staff cost intensity.

3. **Sequential Discipline in FY26:** Despite strong QoQ revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 FY26 (~9-10%), employee benefits were almost entirely flat (**₹2,048 crore** to **₹2,052 crore**). This suggests significant productivity gains and more efficient utilisation of the existing workforce, rather than continuous cost escalation each quarter.

4. **Limited P&L Risk but Worth Monitoring:** Despite these increases, employee expenses constitute a relatively minor portion of Maruti Suzuki's overall cost structure compared to material and purchased vehicle costs. Therefore, they are unlikely to be the primary driver of margin volatility in the near term. However, the consistent trend of staff costs growing faster than revenue over multiple periods suggests that effective Human Resources cost management and productivity initiatives will become increasingly critical for sustaining operating margins in the future.

## Nissan Motor India

### Overview

For **Fiscal Year 2024-2025** (**FY 25**), Nissan Motor India functioned as a "growth pillar" for the global parent organization, achieving its highest annual sales volume in seven years. However, this operational success is juxtaposed with significant pressure on employee expenditure resulting from the Nissan Global "RE: Nissan" restructuring initiative. While manufacturing roles in India maintained relative stability to support robust export demand, the technology and R&D divisions (Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India) experienced workforce rationalization during early 2025 as part of worldwide cost-cutting measures.

### Employee Expense Analysis: FY 2024-2025 (April 2024 - March 2025)

During this fiscal year, employee expenses were influenced by two countervailing forces: high production volume necessitating overtime and incentives, and simultaneous strategic headcount rationalization.

#### Operational Context

**Production Volume:** Nissan India registered domestic sales exceeding **28,000 units** and exports surpassing **71,000+ units**.

**Impact on Expenses:** Elevated export volumes typically result in an increase in variable employee costs (e.g., wages for contract labor, shift allowances) within the manufacturing facility located at Oragadam, Chennai.

#### Key Workforce Developments (FY25)

| Category | Status | Impact on Employee Expenses | Global Context |
|----------|--------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Manufacturing Staff** | Stable / High Utilization | Expenses are likely to have **increased** due to performance incentives linked to the "best sales in 7 years." | N/A |
| **White Collar / R&D** | Under Review | Flat or decreasing. Global directives to reduce "indirect headcount" began implementation in Q4 FY25 (Jan-Mar 2025). | Nissan Global reported a net loss of **¥670 billion ($4.5B)** for FY24-25, prompting a global freeze on non-essential hiring. |

### Analysis of FY 2025-2026: Q1 & Q2 (April 2025 - September 2025)

The first half of FY26 was characterized by a transition from general cost control to active restructuring. The global "RE: Nissan" program, which targets the elimination of 20,000 positions worldwide, commenced impacting Indian operations, specifically within shared services and technology centers.

#### Q1 FY26 (April - June 2025)

**Strategic Layoffs:** Reports from March 2025 indicated that the Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India (RNTBCI) initiated workforce reductions affecting an estimated **500-1,000 employees**.

**Financial Impact:**
- **One-time Costs:** A significant increase in ***severance and settlement expenses*** was recognized during this quarter.
- **Recurring Costs:** A resultant decrease in the monthly wage bill followed the layoffs.

**Global Metric:** Nissan Global reported operating losses during this period, thereby reinforcing the mandate to reduce SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative) expenses, which encompass employee salaries.

#### Q2 FY26 (July - September 2025)

**Stabilization:** Following the substantial adjustments in Q1, Q2 primarily focused on operational efficiency.

**Sales-Driven Expenses:** In October 2025 (immediately subsequent to the close of Q2), Nissan India reported a **45% Month-on-Month sales growth**. This suggests that Q2 involved ramping up production staffing or working increased hours to prepare for the forthcoming festive season demand.

**Restructuring:** The global plan to achieve fixed cost reductions of **¥300 billion** continued to limit new permanent hiring in India, driving increased reliance on the variable/contract workforce for production spikes.

### Detailed Data Table: Estimated Workforce Indicators

While precise INR figures are proprietary, the following table reconstructs the employee expense trajectory based on operational activity and global reporting.

| Metric | FY 2024-2025 (Actual) | Q1 FY 26 (Apr-Jun '25) | Q2 FY 26 (Jul-Sep '25) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Operational Activity** | High (Domestic + Export Growth) | Moderate (Restructuring Phase) | High (Pre-Festive Ramp Up) |
| **Hiring Sentiment** | Selective Replacement | **Freeze / Layoffs** | Contractual Hiring Only |
| **Major Expense Driver** | Production Incentives & Overtime | **Severance Payouts** (Tech Center) | Variable Manufacturing Wages |
| **Global Headcount Trend** | Reduction of 9,000 announced | **Cut increased to 20,000** | Implementation of cuts |
| **India Strategic Role** | "Growth Pillar" for Exports | Cost-Efficiency Hub | Export Hub + Domestic Recovery |

### Qualitative Assessment of Employee Costs

#### Manufacturing vs. R&D Divergence

Nissan's strategy in India has become bifurcated.

1. **Manufacturing (Oragadam Plant):** Employee expenses in this segment are classified as "Cost of Goods Sold." With exports directed toward **65+ markets**, these expenditures are justified by the generated revenue. The workforce in this area is likely stable.

2. **Corporate & R&D (Gurugram/Chennai):** These are considered "Fixed Costs." The global mandate to reduce SG&A by **18%** directly impacts this segment. The reported layoffs in the Technology Center align with the global objective to reduce indirect staff.

#### Future Outlook (FY26 H2)

With the "RE: Nissan" plan aiming to rationalize the global footprint from 17 to 10 bases by 2027, India is positioned to remain a critical surviving base. Nevertheless, employee expenses are anticipated to remain flat or decline as a percentage of revenue, driven by the replacement of high-cost permanent positions with automated processes or leaner team structures.

## Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited

### Overview

Based on the financial disclosures of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited (TMPV) and the Tata Motors Group for the specified fiscal periods, this document provides a detailed analysis of employee benefit expenses within the Passenger Vehicles (PV) segment (4-wheelers). The ensuing analysis primarily focuses on Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited (TMPV) and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited (TPEM), the subsidiaries responsible for the domestic passenger vehicle business, encompassing both Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Electric Vehicle (EV) platforms.

### Employee Expenses Analysis: FY 2024-25 (Annual)

For the fiscal year concluding March 31, 2025 (FY25), the expenditure on employee benefits for the PV business demonstrated a sustained increase. This trend reflects the impact of annual salary increments and strategic workforce expansion necessitated by the burgeoning Electric Vehicle (EV) portfolio.

| Metric | FY 2024-25 (₹ Crore) | FY 2023-24 (₹ Crore) | Change (YoY) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Employee Benefit Expenses** | **4,513** | **4,308** | **+4.8%** |
| **Average Quarterly Cost** | **~1,128** | **~1,077** | **-** |

**Analysis:** Employee costs experienced an increase of approximately 5%, rising to ₹4,513 Crore in FY25 from ₹4,308 Crore in FY24. This rate of increase was relatively contained compared to preceding years, suggesting successful cost stabilization measures concurrently with the expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) division.

**Key Drivers:** The primary factors contributing to this increase were routine annual wage revisions and the recruitment of specialized personnel for the EV segment (TPEM) and software development, which were partially mitigated by gains in operational efficiency.

### Employee Expenses Analysis: Q1 & Q2 FY 2026

The first half of FY26 (April 2025 - September 2025) presented a bifurcated performance: Q1 was marked by demand challenges, while Q2 exhibited a robust financial recovery.

#### Q1 FY 2026 (April - June 2025)

**Context:** The quarter proved challenging for the PV industry, primarily due to elevated channel inventory levels and a deceleration in consumer demand. Segment revenue consequently declined by 8.2% year-over-year (YoY) to ₹10,877 Crore.

**Employee Cost Dynamics:** Although the precise absolute employee expense for Q1 was not individually segmented in the summary press releases, the segment's reported EBITDA margin contracted to 4.0% (a decrease of 180 basis points).

- **Cost Pressure:** The lower revenue base, coupled with the predominantly fixed nature of employee costs, resulted in negative operating leverage, which was a significant contributor to the margin compression.
- **Financials:** The segment reported an Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) loss (a negative margin of -2.8%), clearly indicating that fixed overheads, including employee expenses, disproportionately burdened the results against the lower sales volume of approximately 124,800 units.

#### Q2 FY 2026 (July - September 2025)

**Context:** The PV segment registered a sharp resurgence in Q2, with revenue escalating by 15.6% to ₹13,529 Crore. This recovery was largely propelled by the onset of the festive season demand and the impact of the "GST 2.0" rate reductions.

**Employee Expenses:**
- **Absolute Cost:** ₹1,447 Crore.
- **Analysis:** Employee expenses maintained stability at this quantum, a factor that enabled substantial margin expansion as the revenue base scaled up.
- **As a Percentage of Revenue:** This figure represents approximately 10.7% of the segment revenue (₹1,447 Cr / ₹13,529 Cr), which is considered a sound operational metric for the automotive manufacturing sector.

**Profitability:** The stability achieved in employee costs played a key role in the segment attaining an EBITDA margin of 5.8%, marking a notable improvement over the performance recorded in Q1.

### Summary Table: Employee Expenses & Performance (FY25 - FY26)

| Period | Revenue (₹ Crore) | Employee Expenses (₹ Crore) | EBITDA Margin | Key Observations |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **FY 2024-25 (Annual)** | **~52,000*** | **4,513** | **~6-7%** | **Controlled annual increase of 5% in staff costs.** |
| **Q1 FY 2026 (Apr-Jun)** | **10,877** | **(Est. ~1,400)*** | **4.0%** | **Revenue decline generated negative operating leverage.** |
| **Q2 FY 2026 (Jul-Sep)** | **13,529** | **1,447** | **5.8%** | **Strong recovery; stable employee costs at ~10.7% of net sales.** |

*FY25 Revenue estimate is extrapolated based on quarterly financial run-rates.

## Hyundai Motor India Limited

### Overview

The employee benefit expenses incurred by Hyundai India demonstrated a significant upward trend during the fiscal year 2024-25. This escalation was primarily driven by the execution of annual compensation increments and strategic initiatives for workforce expansion. For the full fiscal year 2024-25, the consolidated employee benefit expenses reached a total of INR 23,112.09 Million (approximately INR 2,311 Crore), marking a considerable increase of 17% over the preceding fiscal year.

In the current financial year (FY26), the consolidated employee costs for the first half (H1) amounted to INR 12,423.51 Million. A marginal sequential reduction in employee expenses was noted between the first quarter (Q1) and the second quarter (Q2) of FY26.

### Annual Employee Expenses Analysis (FY 2024-25)

The fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 (FY 2024-25), was characterized by a substantial increase in workforce costs. Management attributed this rise principally to the annual salary revisions and deliberate hiring programs implemented to facilitate enhanced production capacity.

#### Consolidated versus Standalone Financial Performance

| Particulars | FY 2024-25 (INR Million) | FY 2023-24 (INR Million) | YoY Growth |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Consolidated Employee Expenses | 23,112.09 | 19,754.88 | +17.0% |
| Standalone Employee Expenses | 20,061.07 | 17,316.30 | +15.8% |
| As % of Total Income (Consol) | 3.30% | 2.77% | - |

*(Source: Hyundai Motor India Annual Report FY25 & Financial Results)*

#### Key Findings

- **Cost Efficiency:** While the absolute expenditure increased, employee expenses constitute a comparatively minor proportion of total income (3.30%), which is typical given the company's capital-intensive operational structure.
- **Growth Drivers:** The increase in the expense ratio from 2.77% to 3.30% of total income suggests that the growth rate of workforce costs exceeded that of revenue during this period, largely propelled by the implementation of yearly wage revisions.

### Quarterly Employee Expenses Analysis (FY 2026)

For the ongoing financial year (FY 25-26), the data for Q1 (April-June 2025) and Q2 (July-September 2025) indicates a stabilization of costs following the typically higher disbursements observed in the first quarter.

#### Consolidated Quarterly Trends

| Quarter | Period | Employee Expenses (INR Million) | QoQ Change | YoY Change (vs FY25) |
|---------|--------|--------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Q1 FY 26 | Apr - Jun 2025 | 6,242.13 | - | +13.6% (vs Q1 FY25*) |
| Q2 FY 26 | Jul - Sep 2025 | 6,181.38 | -0.97% | +12.5% (vs Q2 FY25) |
| Total H1 FY 26 | Apr - Sep 2025 | 12,423.51 | - | +12.7% |

*(Note: The Year-on-Year comparison for Q2 is based on the Q2 FY25 figure of INR 5,492.96 Million. Q1 FY25 comparison is inferred from historical trends).*

#### Standalone Quarterly Trends

| Quarter | Period | Employee Expenses (INR Million) |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Q1 FY 26 | Apr - Jun 2025 | 5,442.35 |
| Q2 FY 26 | Jul - Sep 2025 | 5,304.33 |
| Total H1 FY 26 | Apr - Sep 2025 | 10,746.68 |

*(Source: Unaudited Financial Results for the Quarter ended September 30, 2025)*

#### Key Findings

- **Sequential Decline:** A marginal decrease (approximately 1%) in consolidated employee costs was recorded from Q1 to Q2 FY26. This pattern is frequently observed within corporate financial cycles, where the first quarter often includes variable pay disbursements or the implementation of annual appraisal arrears.
- **Year-on-Year Growth:** A comparative analysis of Q2 FY26 (INR 6,181 Million) with the corresponding quarter in the previous year (Q2 FY25: INR 5,492 Million) reveals a 12.5% increase, which is consistent with standard inflationary adjustments and growth in employee headcount.

### Detailed Comparative Data Table

The subsequent table consolidates the "Employee Benefits Expense" line item extracted from the Statement of Profit and Loss for the periods under review.

| Period | Consolidated Expense (INR Mn) | Standalone Expense (INR Mn) | Status |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| FY 24-25 (Full Year) | 23,112.09 | 20,061.07 | Audited |
| Q1 FY 26 | 6,242.13 | 5,442.35 | Unaudited |
| Q2 FY 26 | 6,181.38 | 5,304.33 | Unaudited |
| H1 FY 26 (Total) | 12,423.51 | 10,746.68 | Unaudited |

*(Source: Hyundai Motor India Limited Financial Results)*

### Interpretation and Outlook

- **Expense Ratios:** Notwithstanding the absolute increase in costs, Hyundai India successfully maintained a robust EBITDA margin of 13.9% in Q2 FY26, representing an improvement from 12.8% in the previous year. This suggests that the elevation in employee costs is being effectively absorbed through operational efficiencies and heightened export volumes.
- **Strategic Context:** The growth in employee expenditure aligns with HMIL's "Quality of Growth" strategy, which prioritizes manufacturing capacity expansion and the retention of skilled personnel within the highly competitive automotive sector. The stability observed between Q1 and Q2 FY26 indicates a controlled management of overheads as the company transitions into the latter half of the fiscal year.

### FY 2024-25: Full Year Analysis

The fiscal year 2024-25 reflects a substantial investment by M&M in its human capital, with the total employee benefit expense surpassing the ₹11,000 Crore threshold.

| Metric | Amount (₹ Crores) | Year-over-Year Change |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Total Employee Expenses** | **11,126.17** | **~4.7% Increase (vs FY24: ₹10,624.33 Cr)** |
| **Average Quarterly Cost** | **2,781.54** | **-** |

#### Key Components

The employee benefit expense, as detailed in the annual report, customarily encompasses:
- Salaries, wages, and bonuses.
- Contributions to provident and other statutory funds.
- Share-based payment transactions (Employee Stock Option Plans - ESOPs).
- Staff welfare expenditures.

### FY 2026: Quarterly Analysis (Q1 & Q2)

The first half of FY 2026 (April 2025 - September 2025) demonstrates a pronounced elevation in employee costs compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.

#### Q1 FY 2026 (April - June 2025)

- **Expense:** ₹3,044.52 Crores
- **Comparison:** A 13.6% increase relative to Q1 FY25 (₹2,678.58 Cr).
- **Context:** This quarter immediately captures the financial impact of the annual appraisal cycle, which is typically implemented from April 1st.

#### Q2 FY 2026 (July - September 2025)

- **Expense:** ₹3,111.99 Crores
- **Comparison:** A 17.2% increase compared to Q2 FY25 (₹2,655.22 Cr).
- **Sequential Growth:** A 2.2% escalation from the immediately preceding quarter (Q1 FY26).

#### Half-Yearly Performance (H1 FY 2026)

| Period | FY 26 (Current) | FY 25 (Previous) | Growth (%) |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Q1 (Apr-Jun)** | **3,044.52** | **2,678.58** | **+13.6%** |
| **Q2 (Jul-Sep)** | **3,111.99** | **2,655.22** | **+17.2%** |
| **Total H1** | **6,156.51** | **5,333.80** | **+15.4%** |

### Key Drivers of Expense Growth

The analysis pinpoints several critical factors contributing to the approximate 15-17% increase in employee costs for FY 2026:

- **Annual Increments:** Standard adjustments for inflation and merit-based salary increases, effective from the commencement of the financial year.
- **ESOP Costs:** The Mahindra Group implemented a substantial "One Time ESOP" plan, encompassing 12,000 to 14,000 employees, including factory personnel. This initiative has resulted in a higher non-cash charge recorded against the Profit & Loss (P&L) statement in FY26.
- **Workforce Expansion:** Continued recruitment, particularly within the Research & Development (R&D) and Electric Vehicle (EV) divisions, to support the company's aggressive product launch schedule planned for FY 26 and FY 27.

## Honda Cars India Limited

### Summary

For the financial year FY 24-25, Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) reported Total Expenses of ₹16,619 Crore, an increase of 5.8% year-on-year. While the specific "Employee Benefit Expense" line item is not publicly disclosed for this unlisted subsidiary in interim summaries, the overall expense rise contributed to a 9% decline in Net Profit (₹604 Crore), despite a 4.6% rise in revenue driven by record exports.

For Q1 and Q2 of FY 26 (April-September 2025), specific financial data for the unlisted car unit is
