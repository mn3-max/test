## 2. NISSAN MOTOR INDIA

### FY 2024-25 Overview

Nissan India achieved its **highest annual sales in 7 years** with domestic sales exceeding 28,000 units and exports surpassing 71,000+ units. However, operational success was offset by workforce rationalization under the global "RE: Nissan" restructuring.

**Workforce Developments:**

| Category | Status | Impact on Employee Expenses | Global Context |
|----------|--------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Manufacturing Staff** | Stable / High Utilization | Expenses likely **increased** due to performance incentives for "best sales in 7 years" | N/A |
| **White Collar / R&D** | Under Review | Flat or decreasing. Global directives to reduce "indirect headcount" began in Q4 FY25 (Jan-Mar 2025) | Nissan Global reported net loss of ¥670 billion ($4.5B) for FY24-25, prompting hiring freeze |

### Q1 FY 2025-26 (April-June 2025)

The Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India (RNTBCI) initiated workforce reductions affecting an estimated **500-1,000 employees** starting March 2025.

**Financial Impact:**
- **One-time Costs:** Significant increase in severance and settlement expenses
- **Recurring Costs:** Decrease in monthly wage bill post-layoffs
- **Global Context:** Nissan Global reported operating losses, reinforcing SG&A reduction mandate

### Q2 FY 2025-26 (July-September 2025)

Following Q1 adjustments, Q2 focused on operational efficiency. October 2025 saw **45% Month-on-Month sales growth**, suggesting Q2 involved ramping up production staffing for festive season demand. The global plan to achieve ¥300 billion in fixed cost reductions continued to limit new permanent hiring.

**Estimated Workforce Indicators:**

| Metric | FY 2024-25 | Q1 FY26 (Apr-Jun '25) | Q2 FY26 (Jul-Sep '25) |
|--------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Operational Activity** | High (Domestic + Export Growth) | Moderate (Restructuring Phase) | High (Pre-Festive Ramp Up) |
| **Hiring Sentiment** | Selective Replacement | **Freeze / Layoffs** | Contractual Hiring Only |
| **Major Expense Driver** | Production Incentives & Overtime | **Severance Payouts** (Tech Center) | Variable Manufacturing Wages |
| **Global Headcount Trend** | Reduction of 9,000 announced | **Cut increased to 20,000** | Implementation of cuts |
| **India Strategic Role** | "Growth Pillar" for Exports | Cost-Efficiency Hub | Export Hub + Domestic Recovery |

### Strategic Assessment

**Manufacturing vs. R&D Divergence:**
- **Manufacturing (Oragadam Plant):** Employee expenses justified by revenue from exports to 65+ markets; workforce likely stable
- **Corporate & R&D (Gurugram/Chennai):** Fixed costs subject to global 18% SG&A reduction mandate; significant layoffs in Technology Center

**Future Outlook:** With the "RE: Nissan" plan aiming to rationalize from 17 to 10 global bases by 2027, India remains a critical surviving base. Employee expenses anticipated to remain flat or decline as % of revenue through automation and leaner structures.

## 3. TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED

### FY 2024-25 Overview

Employee benefit expenses for the PV segment reached **₹4,513 crore**, up **4.8%** from ₹4,308 crore in FY24. This relatively contained increase suggests successful cost stabilization alongside EV division expansion.

- Sales volume: ~124,800 units

### Q2 FY 2025-26 (July-September 2025)

Sharp resurgence with revenue escalating 15.6% to **₹13,529 crore**, driven by festive season demand and GST 2.0 rate reductions.

**Q2 FY26 Performance:**
- **Employee Expenses:** ₹1,447 crore (maintained stability)
- **As % of Revenue:** ~10.7% (₹1,447 Cr / ₹13,529 Cr)
- **EBITDA Margin:** 5.8% (notable improvement over Q1)
- **Key Factor:** Stability in employee costs enabled substantial margin expansion with revenue scale-up

**Summary Table:**

| Period | Revenue (₹ Crore) | Employee Expenses (₹ Crore) | EBITDA Margin | Key Observations |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **FY 2024-25 (Annual)** | **~52,000*** | **4,513** | **~6-7%** | **Controlled 5% annual increase** |
| **Q1 FY 2026 (Apr-Jun)** | **10,877** | **(Est. ~1,400)*** | **4.0%** | **Revenue decline = negative operating leverage** |
| **Q2 FY 2026 (Jul-Sep)** | **13,529** | **1,447** | **5.8%** | **Strong recovery; stable costs at ~10.7% of sales** |

### Q1 & Q2 FY 2025-26

The first half of FY26 demonstrates pronounced elevation in employee costs compared to the prior year.

**Quarterly Performance:**

| Period | Expense (₹ Crores) | YoY Comparison | Sequential Growth |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Q1 FY 2026 (Apr-Jun)** | **3,044.52** | +13.6% (vs ₹2,678.58 Cr in Q1 FY25) | Captures annual appraisal cycle from April 1st |
| **Q2 FY 2026 (Jul-Sep)** | **3,111.99** | +17.2% (vs ₹2,655.22 Cr in Q2 FY25) | 2.2% escalation from Q1 FY26 |

### Key Drivers of Expense Growth

The ~15-17% increase in FY26 employee costs is attributable to:

1. **Annual Increments:** Standard inflation and merit-based adjustments effective from financial year start
2. **ESOP Costs:** Substantial "One Time ESOP" plan covering 12,000-14,000 employees (including factory personnel), resulting in higher non-cash P&L charges
3. **Workforce Expansion:** Continued recruitment in R&D and EV divisions to support aggressive product launch schedule for FY26-27

**Note on Reporting:** The figures presented are M&M Standalone (Automotive and Farm Sectors). Consolidated Mahindra Group employee costs are considerably higher (e.g., Tech Mahindra alone reported ~₹8,714 crores for Q2 FY26).

## 6. HONDA CARS INDIA LIMITED

### FY 2024-25 Overview

For FY 24-25, Honda Cars India reported **Total Expenses of ₹16,619 crore** (+5.8% YoY). While specific "Employee Benefit Expense" line items are not publicly disclosed for this unlisted subsidiary, the overall expense rise contributed to a **9% decline in Net Profit** (₹604 crore), despite 4.6% revenue growth driven by record exports.

**Key Financial Metrics:**

| Metric | FY 24-25 (₹ Crore) | FY 23-24 (₹ Crore) | YoY Change |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Total Revenue** | **17,219** | **16,461** | **+4.6%** |
| **Total Expenses** | **16,619** | **15,708** | **+5.8%** |
| **Net Profit (PAT)** | **604** | **664** | **-9.0%** |
| **Domestic Sales (Units)** | **65,925** | **~91,000** | **-27.5%** |
| **Export Sales (Units)** | **Strong Growth** | **~22,000** | **Significant Rise** |

### Employee Cost Dynamics

**Cost Control Focus:**
- In FY24, HCIL explicitly highlighted "cost control concerning employee expenses" as key profitability driver
- This discipline likely continued into FY25 to manage sharp domestic sales decline

**Workforce Optimization:**
- HCIL historically used Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS), notably reducing headcount by 1,300+ employees during Greater Noida and Tapukara plant restructuring
- Current employee base is leaner, with expenses more sensitive to annual increments rather than headcount expansion

**Export Impact:**
- Shift toward "export hub" status (Elevate and City models to Japan/Global markets) requires specialized skilled labor and overtime costs
- May have kept employee expenses firm despite low domestic demand

### Q1 & Q2 FY 2025-26 (April-September 2025)

As an unlisted entity, HCIL does not release public quarterly financial result decks. Analysis derived from parent company reports and market data.

**Operational Context:**

**Q1 & Q2 FY26:**
- HCIL's domestic sales dropped to **lowest levels in nearly two decades**
- Low production volumes typically lead to:
  - **Under-recovery of Fixed Employee Costs:** Permanent salaries become heavier burden per unit
  - **Reduction in Variable Pay:** Overtime, shift allowances, performance bonuses likely reduced

**Global Parent Pressure:**
- Honda Motor Co. (Japan) reported 50% drop in operating profit for Q1 FY26 globally
- Global squeeze translates to regional mandates to freeze hiring and cut discretionary administrative expenses

**VRS Status:**
- No new mass Voluntary Retirement Scheme announced in Q1/Q2 FY26
- Suggests company maintaining core workforce while managing costs through other efficiencies

### Data Constraints

**Unlisted Status:** Honda Cars India is not required to publish quarterly audited "Employee Benefit Expenses." Data sourced from annual summaries via Registrar of Companies (RoC) filings reported by financial news agencies.

**Exclusions:** This analysis strictly excludes Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) and Honda India Power Products (HIPP), whose financials are separate.

### Conclusion

For FY 24-25, Honda's employee strategy was defined by a lean workforce supporting a high-export business model. Total Expenses rose to ₹16,619 crore, but lack of domestic volume growth suggests employee costs were strictly contained to essential increments and export-related production needs. For Q1/Q2 FY26, financial pressure intensified due to 20-year low in domestic sales, signaling a period of frozen discretionary employee spending.
